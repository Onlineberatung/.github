# Contribution Guideline

## What do I need to know to help?
If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out documentation issues. Or even create own issues.

## How do I make a contribution?
Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown:

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/Onlineberatung/repository-name.git.
4. Setup the environment locally, following the guidelines in our [documentation](https://onlineberatung.github.io/documentation/docs/setup/setup-frontend).
5. Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here. In the [project documentation](https://onlineberatung.github.io/documentation/docs/general/git-workflow) you can find the naming conventions for branches.
6. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
7. Use git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
8. Commit the changes to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. We use the specification [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all our commits. We recommend using [Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) in order to comply with this convention without much effort. More information can be found in the [project documentation](https://onlineberatung.github.io/documentation/docs/general/git-workflow).
9. Push the changes to the remote repository using git push origin branch-name-here.
10. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository - it will automatically use our [pull request template](pull_request_template.md) where you can link any issues via #issue-number and further explain your submitted changes.
11. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! ðŸ¥³
